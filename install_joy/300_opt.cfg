# File Format 
#
# There should be a single command on each line.  Commands have the
# form "command" or "command = value", where value can be a boolean,
# an integer, or a string (with no quotes around strings).  If
# "command = 1" is valid, then "command" is a synonym for "command =
# 1".  Omitting "command" from the file is the same as "command = 0".
# Whitespace is unimportant.

# Traffic Selection
#
# if bpf is set to a Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) expression, then
# only traffic matching that expression will be reported on, e.g.
# "bpf = tcp port 443 or ip host 216.34.181.45".  Leave bpf unset to
# observe all IP traffic.

# TLS Fingerprinting
#
# This is the path to the file that will be used by Joy
# as the known dataset upon which TLS flow fingerprinting
# will match entries. If you have placed a custom file in a different
# location, then specify the full path here.
